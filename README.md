### Introduction
#### Game Summary Pitch
Grab your friends, family, neighbors, the neighbor's dog even, and jump into the challenging and funny Lil' Trivial! Full of fun minigames, trivia challenges, and secret sharing sessions, fun is sure to be had by all. The idea is to score the most points across all games to become the champion.

#### Inspiration
Picolo is the inspiration for the trivia and interesting questions portion of the game, asking deep questions to share everyone's embarrassing secrets and thoughts as well as trivia questions to generate a few laughs. Removing the drinking aspect and some of the sauciness of the question styles would be the perfect gap for a family-focused game.

The various minigames come from various inspirations such as pong, cookie clicker, and Super Mario Bros.

#### Player Experience
Players will start a new game by adding all of the player's first names to the list and selecting one or more of the game packs. Then by tapping through the prompts, they'll play the game for a set amount of rounds to determine a winner! They'll be given the option of starting a new game with the same player's or going back to the configuration screen.
